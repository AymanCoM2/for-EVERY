    {
        1- Define all Entites Or things That will be Represented in the Project :
        [ For This Project They are ]:
            0- [ Category && Tag-Label]
                - Because Some Entites below belong to Categories 
            1- User
            2- Lists
                - Special Lists ( Like LinkTree Ones )
                - Special Lists ( List of Lists )
            3- Link "single Link"
            4- Review
    }

    {
        2- Make the [Migration/Model/Controller/{Factory if Needed}] For the Entites
        - All Using One Command $php artisan make:model MODEL -mfc

        ## NOTE : When Creating Entites Make Sure to make the General Entties First
        And Then Make the Other Entites That Belong to Those Big Entites so that
        No problems Happen ( Relational DB and one to Many and Stuff like that )

        To Check If Problems Happen , you Can Do some seeding After Making The Structure Of
        Data and Their Relationships
    }

    {
        3- Start Defining Each Entity and What Data it needs .
        And Put All Relations Between Entites

        - Best Thing To do : For each Part , Review the Documentation
        For Example For Migration Check Column Types available and
        Check if you might Need Some Type Of them

        - NOT NECESSARY to Put all things Now , You Can Always Update Fields
        In the Future
    }

    {
        -Migration
        -Model
        -Controller
        -Factory
    }


After Setting Relationships >> Fill Fake Data
THEN => Each Route = Logic + Screen
    Do them One By Once [ Route = Gate ]
