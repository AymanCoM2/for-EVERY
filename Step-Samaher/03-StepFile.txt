3- Make the Views Folder For Each + Route File
## NOTE : Route and Views are Related , SO Only Make Files and Folders For those
Entites that need Them (In our Case No need For Review View Or Route For now )
    - List as Example >> Folder Called list and Any Related Files Be inside it
    "index,create,update"

    - Route File >> Route(/lists)
        - And All related links Under "/lists" In Once File
        - in the Main Web.php File For Routes Include this Routing File
        Examples For Including
        {
            #~ Route::group(['middleware' => ['auth']], __DIR__ . '/fileName.php');
            #~ Route::group([], __DIR__ . '/fileName.php');
        }
