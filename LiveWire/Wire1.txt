## Step 1 :  CREATION 
{
    ===============================
    1- Creating livewire Component : 
    $ php artisan make:livewire ComponentName 

    This Command will Create Two parts :
        [ Class -> Has Data and Logic ]
        [ View -> A reactive html Component which you Can Embed in any Place ]
        This Means For Example you Can Make Comments Section a [ LiveWire Component ]
        And Rest of Page is Normal Blade But this Means when Embeding 
        this LiveWire-Compoent inside this Balde it will be "Reactive Component"
    ===============================
}

##Step 2 : HTML Component
{
    VIEW file :: Make the Html For the Component ,, 
    Then Embed it inside the View 
    instead of Using "@include()" 
    You include it using this -> <livewire:COMPONENT_name>   
}

##Step 2.1 : Model Data [CLASS + VIEW]
{
    For ANY field on HTML tag , if you want to fill Or "Connect" Its VALUE to a Property in the 
    Class Of the LiveWire Use { wire:model="PropertyName" }
    Example ->  <input type="text" wire:model="firstModelItem">
        => This is Like 'value="XYZ"' ; 
}
