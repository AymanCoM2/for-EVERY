I want to Make it SPA project 

1- There is a Pool Of tasks That you Must Finish EveryDay :
    = Every Day you Get the Tasks AND reminders and Stuff you Need 
    [ ALL together in this Pool which is the main list]

2- User Dashboard Management : (Types Of Lists)
    - TODOS list [ Normal List for Singular Tasks ]
    - Calender List [ Scpecify Date + Time ]
        - Similar to Normal Todo "One Time task"
    - Reminders ? Motication thing ?
    - Quotes  , images , Challenges 
    - Recurring Tasks : 
        - Task REPEATS every("x") -> 

Snooze feature ? Snooze for 3 times then delete ?
Subtasks
Repeat by hour ? 
Ordering Tasks ?
Themes ?
Creating Lists ? But What Would it be helpful for If There is "POOL" ? 
Badges / Urgent ? / 
Comparing to all other apps ??? WEB app is Extra Better for you 
    - Web Sync with Mob and Extension 
Notification [ Mob && web ]
    - Should i make it automatic Or Make User Mark It as "Need Notify"

Drag and Drop Like the "TechyTypes One "?
